##COFFEE SHOP ANALYSIS PROJECT

#Overview
The case study on a coffee shop that has been dropping in sales and CEO is appointed to help it grow. As an analyst I am expected 
analyse the coffee shop data sales over a period of 6months ( 01/01/2023 to 30/06/2023) to identify revenue trends, understand customer behavior, and forecast future sales.
Using Snowflake for data storage and management, I developed code to extract insights from the raw data and exported the results to Excel for visualization and analysis. Through this analysis, I aim to provide data-driven insights that can inform business decisions, identify opportunities to optimize sales and revenue, and develop accurate forecasts to support strategic planning.
The analysis will focus on uncovering patterns and trends in sales data, understanding customer purchasing habits and preferences, and predicting future sales performance to drive business growth.
